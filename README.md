Calculating years of service with benefits

This is a test program, according to Retirement law of Republic of Serbia, for retirement people who has job with accelerated retirement...

According to Retirement law of Republic of Serbia, people who has job with accelerated retirement goes to retire with 40 years of accelerated years of service and 53 years of life... So, I've calculated for myself when will I go to retirement according to this law...

My 53rd birthday is May 24th, 2029., so this table is data of my career in Serbian armed forces without and with accelerated coefficient.

When I finish with it, I hope to work in IT company somewhere abroad... I'd like to go to United Kingdom or to Spain at Mediteranian coast, but if not, everywhere else will be good. I'd like to upgrade myself with programing skills in some big IT company.
